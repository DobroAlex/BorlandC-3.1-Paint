# BorlandC-3.1-Paint
Application similar to MS™©® Panint™©® created in BorlandC 3.1 IDE as a simple task for studnets
This application was created according to my task as a student to lear how to use simple ancient graphics and to crate own simple retarded text-image editor similar to    to MS Paint. I succeed so now U can use it as U wish even despite the fact I'm sure that no one use BorlandC Graphics.h in our days
